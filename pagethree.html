            <h1>We Were Swimming Buddies</h1>
            <p>If you cannot stand melodramatic stories, then you might want to skip over this one. But it shows it the inner feeling of loss so clearly. If you can, I encourage you to read the story from your own perspective, step into the experiences, make the 'I' you. </p>
            <p>I do not mean to tell you that this is what life is like; I am portraying a human emotion that rarely gets put into words. The goal of this story is to reach you with the reality of the emotions that go on in another person's life; to give you the experience of feeling emotions that are not your own, but someone else's. Maybe it will be insightful to understanding how other people around you may or may not perceive the world, though they may not show it. <p>
            <br>
            <p>I’d met her when I went to my first swimming school- I was very nervous, as I’d always been terrified of water. We walked into the building, and there was this girl in the back surrounded by a bunch of other kids- she was soaking wet. She was covered from head to toe in water- I stared. I stared at the water. I felt as if I was drowning already- the whole thought of water touching my skin terrifying me. I glanced at her face, and she looked annoyed, and I realized the people around her were picking a fight. I looked back at her. She was not helping her situation- she kicked away feet that came to close, talking back to some guy in pool clothing. He glared at her. She glared back. I felt the tension rising, and my heart was beating rapidly- I should have done something, but I was too scared, so, instead, I closed my eyes and hid behind my hands.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I woke up staring into her face. No- her face and my mother’s face. I blinked, and tried to stay composed- her skin and clothes were still soaked. I sat up, backing away from her soggy self, aware of her watching me do it and not reacting. My mother smiled at me sympathetically, ruffled my hair, and started speaking at me. They’d signed me in, I’d be here for the rest of the following four hours, dad had already left, and maybe this girl could help me overcome my fear of water. She’d be going now. Good luck. I stared at my feet in a daze, but then realization hit me in the face and I jumped to my feet, ran at the glass door, watched as my mother’s car left the parking lot. I felt alone, scared, and confused. She’d told me this was going to happen- I’d be enrolled to get accustomed to water, she’d leave me as soon as she dropped me off, but there’d be teachers and other adults I could go to. They were informed of ‘my situation’. I watched the empty street, half expecting to wake up and find her bending over me, worried.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I spun around when the girl tapped me on the shoulder. She looked at me, confused, then shrugged and introduced herself. She told me about herself, asking occasional questions, which I answered just as occasionally. She ran over to the check in counter and reached past the lady sitting there, got slapped, and quickly pulled back. She puppy-eyed the lady behind the counter, and asked for my check in papers. The lady sighed, glanced at me- and I’m sure I must have been staring and looking like an absolute freak- and then assured her that I was checked in, but that I had a few different goals for the year. She glanced at me, then grabbed my hand, and pulled me off in one direction. It happened too quickly and new for me to be scared- except for the fact that her hand was damp and I was trying to get away from the wet and her hand was squeezing mine, forcing the water up my arm and surely it must be spreading, in a few minutes it must be all the way to my head, because that’s how water works, surely it would evaporate on to my head, go into my brain, and kill all the brain cells- other than that, I was too confused and taken off guard to react much. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>She pushed open a glass door in corridor 9, left hall, to the pool number 5B. I’d done so much research on this place, that I’d practically memorized it. I froze. In front of me was the largest pool I’d ever seen, with kids falling in and drowning and splashing- trying to stay above water and contaminating themselves with it. I wasn’t sure what was happening to the people on the inside, and I wasn’t about to find out. My brain was reeling. The water was leaking on the floor, coming closer to me. I stumbled backward, into the hall, trying to get away, my brain numbed. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>She left me, and walked off. I freaked out, collapsed in the carpeted hallway, attempting not to vomit in this hallway, trying to remember where the bathroom in this building was. I stared at the carpet, on my knees, trying to get up and walk myself over to the bathroom. She appeared in front of me before I could, looked down at me quizzically, then reached down to take my hand, and pulled me up. I flinched at the touch of water and immediately wiped my hands off on my sweater, and didn’t stop wiping them off until my hands were burning.</p>

            <br>
            <p>She took no notice, but started walking along the corridor- away from the bathroom- but she obviously meant for me to follow her. She walked into a room- I later recalled that it was room 2A in corridor 1B. It was dry. No water. No pool. Just glass windows, and posters of pools, and sprinkler in the corner, turned off. There were a few benches on the sides. She sat down on the bench and started talking to one of the posters of pools, filled with water. I watched her, and then looked at the poster. In the one she was talking to, there was a mermaid sitting on the edge, and she was looking back at her, smiling. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I let my eyes wander over the images, because they were paper, and not water- so safe- and some of them contained divers, grinning at the person looking at the poster, kids on floaties laughing in the water, shallow water, animals swimming in water, and even animals that lived in very deep water. There were so many, I sat down, a good distance from her because she was wet, but looked at the posters. She looked at me as I did, and then she stood up, and touched the poster she was talking to, tracing the curves of the waves in the pool. I watched her, and she pointedly watched me to see if I would. I hesitated. It was on paper, but it looked so real. She did it though, and no water came out, and I didn’t see any evidence of her becoming any more wet than she already was. I slowly stood up, leaving my bag on the bench, and touched the image short, quick, and then backed away to examine my finger. It was dry, and I was amazed. I did it again, and it was still dry. She smiled. She then dug in her backpack, found a cup, and walked to the other side of the room, softly turned on the sprinkler, filling the cup, and slightly dampening the floor.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I backed away. She turned off the sprinkler, and walked toward me with the cup. The wet cup. I backed away. She stopped. Set the cup down. Sat down. Put the tip of her finger in it, and watched me. I watched her. The situation stayed like that for about half an hour, and then my curiosity got the better of me and I walked over to see how her skin was reacting. To my surprise, it still looked the same. She actually took it out of the water to show me. I was flabbergasted. My entire philosophy on water was potentially crumbling. I watched for a long time. She just sat there. For an hour. While I watched. She was obviously waiting for me to copy her, but I couldn’t. I watched. I sat down next to her, watching her finger. She took my hand and lifted it slightly above the cup. I jerked it back, and she gently smiled back, picking up my hand again. For some reason I trusted her. She took my hand and hovered it above the cup. I didn’t feel any condensation. She let go, but I left my hand there, feeling the air. I started to feel my fingers dampen when I lowered them slightly above the water, and I pulled them away. I studied my fingers, and was about to dry them off, but she grabbed hold of my wrist. She told me to look at my finger. Told me to watch it. What was happening? What effects were there? What was I afraid of? Did I see it come to life on my finger? I listened to her, and watched my finger; nothing seemed to be happening- my brain wasn’t melting, my finger wasn’t melting or rashing, and I was even thinking straight. I was confused. She let go of my hand, smiled, and put the tip of her finger in again, looking at me. I studied my finger for a long, long time. By the end of the four hours, I had put my entire finger in the water. I felt so tired, so exploited, so proud. I felt like I’d overcome something; I’d overcome the barrier between me and life, between my life and the lives of others, between my mind and my emotions. I could be fixed- I wasn’t born wrong- I wasn’t crazy- I wasn’t mutated.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>Her name was Olive.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>We hung out often, after that- mom would pick us both up from swimming lessons, and we’d build forts, joust, play the piano together until mom told us to stop, play tricks on my older sister, and often she’d join us for dinner. I went over to hers sometimes, but it wasn’t as fun there, because her parents would let us make less of a mess. Once we made a fort in her room, but her parents wouldn’t let us eat in it, and we had to take it down before we came down to eat. They were nice though, they made me my favorite foods, and often, when I was over, they’d open the door to their backyard, which was usually closed, so that we could play soccer, knights, and fight outside. She had a trampoline. </p>
            <br>
            <p>She taught me during the four hours I had daily. She was able to get out of her class, and I didn’t ask how for the longest time. I eventually found out. She would demonstrate, show me that everything would be fine, do it again, and again, and then try to get me to copy her. She held my hand when I couldn’t hold on to the wall or a bar, and made sure it was dry so that I’d be sure I wouldn’t slip. After a few months, I was comfortable with standing to my neck up in water, gripping something that was not underwater, preferably dry. She made me feel comfortable in more and more water-related situations, and she took her time, without forcing me into anything. I felt safe with her- I trusted her. She gave off a radiance of confidence, from the moment I had seen her, standing up to the group of kids around her, never even looking scared, glaring back. I had trusted her for no logical reason at all, until I accidentally saw her swimming once. </p>
            <br>
            <p>It was during one of the swimming lessons she was required to attend. I think it was some kind of an assessment, and I was wondering how she’d get through because she’d spent days of the week with me, not in her class. I decided to watch from behind the glass doors. There were rings set up under the water, low and high, flags marking corners to turn at, markers under water; in total I would guess about a 100m stretch of swimming. Her classmates looked pretty nervous, which I could appreciate. She did not. There was something in her face that I couldn’t decipher though; it appeared every time she looked at the coach watching her from the side- he looked very stern. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>She went first, stood at the start, and the timer at the end raised his hand, the front man snapped his fingers, and she dove under the water. I could see her figure gliding under the water, easily passing through the rings, touching all the required marks, turning sharply at the corners. She only came up for breath once, in that entire stretch. I would have been extremely worried, except that I walked along the glass doors, or rather, ran, because she moved so fast, so that I could see her. She was up at the end in slightly more than one minute. My mind was completely overblown. I didn’t realize what she had just done was possible. I watched a few others swim the same course, but all of them took much longer, took more breaths, and were much less graceful, like puppets. She’d looked like a mermaid, or like the water was more natural to her than the air. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>My parents saw a huge improvement in me, and they showed such obvious relief and happiness that I felt so proud of myself. I found myself letting go of a grudge I’d held against myself for years- being a burden to my parents for avoiding all forms of water in all situations. I could shower, wash my hands, drink, even mop. My parents were so relieved, they almost radiated lightheartedness, happiness, joy. Their entire attitudes had changed- they were more free, less stressed out, more free. They knew I would drink from a cup, and would be able to handle a spill by myself. In the past, I’d refused to consume any liquid, so my parents had to either force me to take in liquid- which I would try to vomit up afterwards for hours- or feed me tons of jello-type substances, which I did not realize had liquid in them. I’d always been an outlier at school, never had any friends, shied away in the winter, afraid the snow would turn into water on me. I’d never had any sort of normal human friendships, besides a ton of doctor’s appointments- none of which could figure out what was wrong with me- and my parents, who were always trying to get me to drink, force me to do stuff, try to get me over my fear of water. Their last attempt was to enroll me into this swimming school, which at first, I’d heavily protested to, but when I got used to the idea, and they explained that I wouldn’t actually have to touch the water, just get accustomed to be around it for a few hours a day, I consented- also because I felt like such a huge burden to my parents already. I felt such a rush of pride, of humanity, when I saw this change in my parents. It was the best thing that could happen to me, and it motivated me to keep trying.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>Olive had a dog named Nox. When I went over to her house, and it was sunny weather, we would walk him outside. I would still wear my raincoat, afraid of surprise rain showers, but that was a habit that didn’t destroy our friendship. She accepted me as I was, and liked her in her authenticity. Once, when we were walking Nox, we’d taken such a long route around the block, that we both got lost. We spent the rest of the afternoon knocking on people’s doors trying to get directions. Turned out we had walked to a completely different town, because our town was pretty small. We eventually found our way back to my house, where Olive stayed the night and slept on the couch with Nox. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>We stayed friends for months, and she stayed my unofficial swim coach for months as well. She was the first and only friend I’d ever had, and I got the feeling she didn’t have very many friends, though she always was cheerful, and never complained or seemed upset. I’d never asked. She was always herself, not afraid of anything, absurdly good in the few things she was interested in, and attempting things she was not interested in for the sake of others, and sincerely enjoying it because they did. This was such a distinct personality trait in her that I didn’t see in anyone else- through all of the people watching I’ve done in the past. Her sympathy, observance, understanding, and care for others were so authentic and natural that it almost seemed unnatural. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first summer spent with her- I’d started my ‘swimming lessons’ in Spring, and I’d gotten to the point where I was not afraid to go into the water almost completely, holding my head above the water and holding on to something stable. I was no longer afraid of rain, and was starting to develop an enjoyment for it, sprinklers, and splashing water, as long as I was in control. We would play in her backyard in a small pool set out, and we would splash water at each other to overcome the heat. I ate popsicles with her, fully aware that they were made with water, and I wasn’t afraid. When it rained, we would rush downstairs, to go take Nox for a walk. I started to associate rain with Nox and Olive, because nobody else would go into the rain, and we would see very few people when we were out in the rain. We loved the rain, the splashes, and the lack of people outside. We would end up talking for hours. She told me she didn’t have very many friends, that she was often picked on, because she was so confident, and often didn’t fit in. She often expressed her frustration at people always trying to fit in, and never being authentic- this was usually done in a joking manner, but I could see the true feeling behind it. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>She was much more observant than most people- once we were walking with Nox, and she suddenly told me to stop, wait with Nox, and she’d be back in a sec. I ran after her with Nox, and saw her trying to catch a kitten that was jumping around scared. She caught it, and first calmed it down, sat down, and started examining the bottoms of its paws. There was a tiny screw in one of them, and she pulled it out swiftly, before letting the kitten go again. She could also tell when there was something off with me, when I was having a bad mood, or when something had happened at home. This was unnerving at first, but I got used to it after I spent more time with her. I was kind of the opposite- I could never tell emotions, by looking at faces, and body language only made it more confusing. She would tell me when something was off, and I’d believe her.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>We decided on being best friends two months after we met. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>We’d been planning my birthday for weeks before it happened, and we’d chosen a skatepark close to a restaurant, a few towns further North. I didn’t invite anyone besides her family, but it was the best thing I’d ever had with someone. We played basketball on skates, which was really funny because she was good at basketball, but terrible at skating. We’d tried practicing skating before the party, so she knew how to move, but she didn’t understand the concept of stopping, so she kept crashing into stuff. Every time she shot, she would end up on the ground, because of the lunge she made at the board, and the inability to keep her balance. I usually ended on the ground, trying to stop my skates from rolling over her, and laughing so hard that I fell over. When she got the hang of skating a little better, we tried to eat our fries while playing basketball on skates. That didn’t go so well, but it was so much fun. Our fries ended up on the other side of the court from where we were, and we spent a long time speculating how the weight of fries could contribute to their ability to fly such a distance. My father and mother, and her mother, joined in on playing basketball, though only after we ditched our skates. We spent the entire afternoon there, and ended it with eating pizza at the restaurant next to the park. It was served with happy birthday napkins, and I wasn’t sure whether or not not to say thank you. She did it for me, naturally creating an awkward, but hilarious situation. The waitress got confused as to whose birthday it was, and she took on my identity, and at that point, my parents were completely lost in the conversation. Her parents seemed used to it, and laughed along. She waved the waitress away, with the order to “spread happiness”. She slept at mine, and we were allowed to stay up till midnight, but we ended up being too tired to finish the movie we had started watching when we got home, and fell asleep early. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>There was a mansion in the back of the town that was considered to be ‘haunted’. I believed it was inhabited by a grumpy old man who liked being alone, hunting, and watering his flowers. Mainly because I had never seen anyone else at that house, and I had seen an old man water his flowers, walk out with a hunting rifle, and I assumed he liked to be alone because I never saw him in town and I assumed nobody else had because otherwise the mansion wouldn’t be called haunted. I wasn’t too afraid of the place- it looked really cool, but it was off limits for everyone in the town. Parents warned kids away, keep out signs were marked on the house, it was in the back of the town. But the mansion had such a beautiful forest as its backyard, and such a large one too. It had so many raspberries, so fresh, completely wild. Both of us loved raspberries, but we were not willing to go to the store for them, assuming the position that stores were ‘not authentic’. We both knew there was more behind that excuse, but neither of us stated it out loud. On a darker day- no rain, but enough to keep people inside- we took a picnic basket and a blanket and snuck out of the house. The mansion looked a lot scarier when we looked up at it, and I was very aware that the very thought of breaking the sacred ‘rule’ of the ‘forbidden’ mansion was unnerving for both of us. But she set forward, and threw the blanket and picnic basket over the fence, and climbed up it. I followed her, my heart beating wild, excited though. Both of us kept an eye on the mansion windows, but the curtains stayed shut. As soon as we were over, we ran around the mansion, got out of view as quickly as possible, and ran into the forest, where we ran until I dropped down, panting, and she fell down next to me, her face beaming with the excitement of risk-taking. After we lay there for a bit, we both hurriedly spread the blanket, and started looking for raspberries, still not quite having caught our breaths. We could only find a few- we were probably in the wrong part of the forest. However, we did see one of the most beautiful things I’d seen in my life. Our nerves were already really high, so when we heard a twig crack, both of us froze, and when it cracked again, we both dove under the blanket, knowing it was pointless, but hiding nevertheless. The cracking stopped a few meters from us, and after having found out neither of us had been shot, she peeked out, and then whispered to me to look. I looked out, and immediately stopped moving. I saw the most beautiful deer, and it was standing only a few meters from us, watching us very warily. A little calf came bounding up to it, and then I coughed, and they ran away. </p>

            <br>
            <p>We both came out from under the blanket, and realized we’d both been holding our breaths. We stared at the empty spot, and I reached over to touch it. She came up next to me, and we left in a kind of trance. This was probably why we were spotted. We’d left the picnic basket behind in our forgetfulness, and as we were climbing back over the fence, I heard a voice behind me. It startled me so bad that I let go of the fence, scratched my back, and landed roughly on the cement. I stared up. It was mr. old man who liked watering plants, hunting, and being alone. Olive looked very pale, a lot more scared than I did. I’d seen this man before, having watched the house every day for years from my bedroom room, having nothing better to do. I knew he wouldn’t harm a fly, and that was evident to me when I faced him, and I felt stupid in my position. She looked as if she was gonna faint. I grabbed her hand, and tried to calm her down, while responding to mr. old man who liked watering plants, hunting, and being alone. He smiled at me, handed me the forgotten picnic basket, and told me to follow him to his house. I did, and pulled her with me. She stopped resisting as soon as she realized I was not scared, and that I trusted he wouldn’t shoot us. That’s another thing I admired in her; she was able to let go of any emotion that she deemed unnecessary, by choice. Mr. old man who liked watering plants, hunting, and apparently not being alone, led us into his kitchen, where we spent the rest of the afternoon. But as we were about to leave, it started raining, so we stayed for dinner as well. He became one of our greatest friends over the years, and we would visit him regularly, after our swim lessons. He liked Nox, and even made a batch of dog cookies for him once.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>With winter came the approach of Olive’s birthday. We spent weeks planning it, and she had deemed me ‘waterproof enough’ to attend a pool party. We’d not go in the deep part, but the slides were shallow, and I didn’t mind splashing, and most water was fine, even fun, as long as I was not immersed completely, and I felt something solid. I was really looking forward to this.
</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Today we planned the food, the events of the night following the event, and she decided impromptu that I’d be sleeping at hers, and we’d have a midnight party. I think she’s very reasonable with this, because I’ve found out firsthand that spending time in water keeps you awake. I hear Olive’s mom outside, and I slide off Olive’s bed and run down to open the door before she can put the key in the lock. She laughs, and I ask her if she bought us any snacks. She hands me a bag of chips, which I immediately take up to Olive, of course called after by her mom to eat it at the table downstairs. Olive comes down, rolling her eyes, but sits down at the table, turns on the TV, and snatches the chips from me. I grab it back, and both of us forget to look at the TV. The chips ends up on the floor, but we do too, laughing, scrambling around on the floor, stuffing as much as we can into our mouths. I can’t wait till next week. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I stay the night at hers. We eat tortillas, and play charades during dinner. Her parents join- I call them by their first names now. When it’s her mom’s turn, I cannot figure out what she is trying to be. All three of us end up guessing, but she’s just waving her arms around, and occasionally sighing, dropping her face on the table, peeking up, and laughing, and then resuming. None of us get it, and she ends up giving up after about five minutes. An ape. What the heck- why hadn’t I thought of that? Olive acts out water, which I get really quickly, and then fire, which I also immediately get. We’re way ahead of her parents- but what do you expect? We’re kids- we have a bigger imagination, we’re naturally better actors. When I say this to her father, he laughs, and pinches my arm, and I run away, hiding behind the couch. Olive sneaks up behind me and throws a pillow at me. I’m stunned, and fall forward, straight into her father. He picks up a pillow and throws it at Olive, but she ducks. Her mom immediately takes her side, and a pillow fight ensues.

            <p> It’s dark outside, but we take no notice. Eventually Olive drops down on the ground dramatically and sighs that she can’t take no more. Her father drops next to her and starts to tickle her- she manages to somehow resist and not laugh. Her mom starts cleaning up the pillows, mumbling something jokingly about ‘getting carried away’. I pretend not to hear and drag Olive away from her dad. She jumps up and pulls me on the couch, pointedly stares at the TV, until I walk towards her father and ask him to put on a movie. He glances at Olive, smirks, then replies that he will when she’s asleep. I glare at him, and he relents anyway. We watch some documentary about animals in Alaska for about one and a half hours, but then Olive falls asleep and falls over on the couch. I find it very funny, except that I’m extremely tired as well. I pull her back into a sitting position, and lean back against the couch, closing my eyes. We both fell asleep on the couch, and I know this because I woke up on the couch, with a blanket around me, and she was gone. Her parents probably put her to bed. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I throw the blanket off, and jump upstairs to see if she’s awake yet. She’s not, so I bonk loudly on the door. I wait, and do it again. I’m usually completely awake in the morning; she’s not. Slowly the door opens, and I bounce in, laughing at her disheveled hair. She looks at me confused, then slowly starts grinning. I tell her she fell over on the couch last night, but didn’t wake up- in response she thoroughly examines her head for any signs of bruises, blood, or gaping holes. She asks me to check underneath a strand on the top of her head, to see if her head had split there. I obey, but when I’m checking, she ducks and backs up, throwing me off balance, and I fall over. She laughs and grabs her blanket off her bed and throws it over me, and runs out of the room. I crawl out of the blanket, and run after her. I find her sitting at the dinner table, calmly eating cereal, with a completely straight face, and her mother in the kitchen. She smirks at me- there are a few signs of the hasty preparation; the bowl is surrounded by cereal flakes, the milk is slightly spilled, and her chair isn’t straight. I glare at her, grab my bowl, and sit next to her. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>We spend the next couple of days in absolute bliss- we only have one fight. On Friday, I want to hold Nox while we walk, but she is adamant that I am not ready and Nox likes her better. While this starts off jokingly, I get upset, and walk away. She runs home, very upset, and I’m upset as well. Mom talks to me, and I call her that night, and apologize, and she tells me it’s okay and I can walk Nox the next day. We’re both very happy, and spend the rest of the evening talking over the phone- until mom finds out how long we’ve been talking and makes me hang up. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The next day I come over to her- we don’t have swimming lessons on Saturday- and we hang out in her room. She’s kind of pacing, but I don’t know what it means. Eventually she sits down next to me, and tells me she wants to tell me something. I’m pretty sure this is serious, so I sit down and listen. She tells me that she is a really good swimmer, and is often bullied at the swimming school. Her coach gives her extra assignments, because she doesn’t learn from the things her class does, but she’s not allowed to join in a higher group. A lot of kids take offense at her, and sometimes they wait for her outside class- this is why she was ashamed that I’d waited for her after the time I watched her in class. Usually she’s waited on by a few kids, who mock her, and express their frustration in ways that aren’t okay. She hasn’t told her parents, because she doesn’t want them to talk to the coaches. I feel bad for her, and tell her I’ll back her up, and I’m really thankful for her teaching me. She looks thankful, but she also admits that she wants to tell her parents, because it’s getting worse, but she’s scared. I tell her I can go with her, but she says no. She just wanted to know my side of it first, and now she’ll tell them, she’ll be right back. With that, she’s gone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I’m surprised. I didn’t know you could get bullied for something you did well. I want to help her, but I don’t know how. I’m glad she’s telling her parents, but I don’t know what they’ll do. She comes up again, breathless, and tells me that she did it, and that they will talk to her coach at school. She looks really relieved. I’m happy for her. She takes me outside, and we play knights. We go inside for lunch.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After lunch, her mom phones her coach. We listen, and afterwards she tells us that the coach wasn’t aware of the situation, and that he’ll watch for anyone, and that he’d have a good talk with the kids who had bullied her. All three of us look very happy. We spend the rest of the day practicing at a swimming pool closeby, outdoors, because she wants me to be able to go without hands. I end up holding her hands, but no longer the wall. She laughs, teases me, but I can see she’s proud of me. She leads me to the middle of the pool, where it’s about waist deep, and slowly lets go of one of my hands. I grip it harder, thinking I’ll lose my balance. She holds it out, but far away, I try balancing with only one hand holding on to her. I succeed, and to my surprise, I do not fall over. I let go of her other hand for a few seconds, find I don’t fall, and grab hold again, my fear getting the best of me. She’s beaming. I’m pale, and splash back to the side. I’m so proud. I can’t believe it. I stood in a pool, waist deep, without holding on to something. I stare at the pool, and after a few minutes, I tell her I want to try again. But I want to wade in alone, but she needs to promise to catch me if I go off balance. She does, and wades in in front of me. I’m halfway to the middle of the pool, when I freak out, and lose my balance slightly- immediately she catches me, and keeps me in an upright position. I’m extremely relieved, and realize there’s no way I’ll drown with her anywhere near me. I’ve seen her speed under water, and I’ve read about kids drowning. Drowning would take at least 10 seconds, and even if we were in a different pool twice this size and she was on the far end of it, she would still be able to swim over and get me above the water before I drowned. That would probably take about 3 seconds. It then dawns on me how good of a swimmer she is, and I suddenly feel safer in the water than I’ve ever felt. I let go of her, and instead of backing out like I want to, I push on, and reach the middle of the water with no hands. She claps her hands, very happy. She then wades over to the side, which makes me nervous, but she comes back with a blown up beach ball, which we toss back and forth in this position. I am starting to feel comfortable in the water, and after a bit, I tell her I want to go deeper. She accompanies me, and at the end of the afternoon, I’m able to go chest-deep in the water, without holding on to her- for a short time. It’s scary, but I feel safe when she’s near me- I know there’s no way I could drown with her watching me. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sunday comes, and she comes over to my house to play games. We don’t like doing things on Sunday, because everything is so quiet, and our parents like to do stuff for themselves. We play board games in my room, and the day is over before I know it. Tomorrow is her birthday party. I cannot wait, but she decides to leave early, so that we can both go to bed early and we can be very awake tomorrow, and we can do as much as possible. With this in mind, I try to sleep right after dinner, but it takes a little longer. I end up calling her, and she answers- she still sounds wide awake. We talk about the pool- the huge slide in it, how badly she wants to go down it with me, how badly she has wanted to go to this pool for so long, and how she’ll show me a dolphin kick in the big pool, and how the slide even has themes you can choose from. It’s huge- we’ve both researched the building. There’s a pool where there are controlled waves, water that is so deep that even adults can’t reach the floor without diving- this terrifies me but excites her. She wants to try dolphin kicking in the waves there, and she wants me to watch. I’m not scared for her, but there’s no way I would do that. She tells me she’ll take a mermaid tail, which is a lot harder to swim in, and she’s going to try to do the dolphin kick with that. We talk until a bit past midnight, when we both start yawning, and hang up. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>The next day, she picks me up very early- as in- 4 AM- I’m not even fully awake then. But she insists on going this early, so I get dressed, grab my stuff, and hop in. My parents will come a little later- her parents will stay with us while we stand in line for hours- I tell her that there’s no point in standing in line for hours, but she tells me that not all points are sharp. I’m confused, but take it as a metaphor. We fight in the backseat, and she’s brought a lot of snacks. I brought candy, chips, and her present- I’m really proud of it. I made a tiny mermaid form, which took me about a month- it was very precise and painstaking work, but my mom helped me. I worked on it every day, but she never found out. My father welded a small bowl of glass to fist size, and I fill it with water and blue glitter and drop the mermaid in it. My father welds the little bowl shut, making it a glass sphere, filed with a mermaid, which looks like it’s swimming when you move it, and the blue glitter makes you think of the reflection the sun has on water- I saw this through the glass panes at the swimming school- they reflect so colorfully on the water that I can’t help but be awed. I can’t wait to give it to her, and my plan is to give it to her after the pool party, when I’m over at her house for the sleepover. I can already see the smile on her face when I give it to her.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>Right now, it’s hidden in my bag in a lot of soft tissue to prevent it from breaking in the car. The mermaid is probably doing somersaults in it- I snicker, and Olive shoves me. At first I think it’s because she’s read my mind, which she does very often, but it turns out her favorite song has come on the radio, and she wants me to sing along with her. I do. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We arrive at the pool entrance about two hours early, so we wait in line by playing games she brought, eating my candy, and singing along to the music that’s always playing at this place- even when it’s closed, I know because I researched it. It’s kind of weird, but both of us find it a very great phenomenon right now. When my parents arrive, the gate is almost going to open- in fifteen minutes Olive’s super-duper-great birthday party will start, and I’ll go down the slide with her. We’ve already decided on the theme we want to do first. And second, and third. We’re the first in line, and the ticket lady smiles at us when we hand in our tickets- we probably look way too hyper to be safe inside- she jokes to my father that we might need to be calmed down before she can let us in. Both of us heavily protest, and run through the little gate before she can act through, and our parents follow, laughing. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>We are sprinkled with water first, because that is some stupid rule the swimming pool has, and then we run out into the pool to explore. It’s really big, and it looks totally tropical. I stay away from the deeper areas, but she jumps in and out of stuff as we explore. The place is quickly filling with people, and she’s not the only one in the water. I walk along the side, and she swims along, chattering excitedly. After about half an hour, we’ve gotten the inside explored, so we head outside. She goes underwater, and I run outside to wait for her. She appears with a somersault underwater, which I admire, and laugh about. She’s so in her element- it’s so obvious. I run over to the smaller pool, which has a console with buttons- I press on the one called ‘theme’. I pick one, and music starts playing and lights start flashing. I dangle my feet in the water, and slowly lower myself in. She dives in and circles my feet, and I know she’s in control, even though it might seem to me that she’s not. We spend a while there, but when the sound track ends, we want to go to the slide. The big one with the themes, the big one that we’ve talked about for days. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>We run inside, or rather, I run inside, and she swims inside- naturally she’s waiting for me. I see the slide before she does though- it’s really well camouflaged, between grapevines, painted walls, and goes into the larger pool- starting really shallow, with a net to catch you after you come out.  I stare. It’s huge. Like really really huge. I can’t see the top. Even Olive is somewhat taken aback, but then she starts walking up the stairs. I follow, hesitant. The stairs are very long, and we’re panting when we reach the top, and gaze into the gaping hole. I can feel my heart beating really hard, and don’t think I can do it- there’s no way. She would be in control, yes, but it’s so deep. So big. I can’t see the bottom, it’s just flashing lights, music, and buttons we’re supposed to press as we slide down, collecting points. She is hesitant as well, but sets foot in it. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sirens are blaring, the area is filled with red lights, a voice comes over the loudspeaker telling everyone to evacuate the building. The building’s structure has been damaged. Evacuate. Evacuate. Don’t use any of the facilities, but use the stairs, get to the ground floor as soon as possible, evacuate the building using the nearest exit you can find. Evacuate. Evacuate. I pull Olive down the stairs, and we’re both terrified. Arriving at the bottom, I can see the glass doors outside cracking and falling to pieces, but I run towards them anyway- we need to get out. Olive doesn’t follow- pulls free. Her head is turned in the direction of the huge deep pool, the one that waves, and her face is tight, listening. Suddenly she tenses, and starts running as fast as she can towards it. Her face changed to a  mixture of determination, fear, and something that I couldn’t make out. There was a reason. Something. I don’t understand. I’m confused. I scream. The slide is collapsing- I don’t know what is happening. Why did she go in? I sam through the collapsing doors, which crash down on the ground behind me, with the beams above it threatening to give way. I try to see her through the rubble, but there’s no way. It’s chaos. There’s no way she could go out via this entrance, when she came out. She’d be fine, she’s such a good swimmer, she could survive anything. Waves would never be a problem for her- she’d faced much larger waves than the ones here, even with the roof collapsing and things falling in the water and creating even larger waves. A swimming pool is her area- there’s nothing she couldn’t face here.
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I hear crying, loud crying, and I see a child sobbing in front of the collapsed door, and I find myself pushing aside broken glass, pushing through, in a kind of a trance- it’s Olive- she’ll come through after the child. The kid stumbles through the glass as soon as there is an opening, sobbing- he has dark brown hair, very wet, bright blue eyes, filled with tears, and only a few teeth. His shorts are ripped- he’s very small, and his entire body is filled with scratches, and bruises. People are running from all sides, and the child slips away without my noticing. I push aside the broken glass, ignoring my cut and bleeding hands, to provide room for Olive to come tumbling through- but what I hear is not her voice, but the slide above me rumbling. Everyone backs up- I’m pulled away by someone, jerked roughly in the direction of the parking lot. A huge piece of the ceiling crashes down in the building, scattering rubble all around us. Water is everywhere, a thunderous splash form inside is heard, followed by the shattering of glass. I run towards the entrance, hitting the arms around me, not even aware of my own tears, pushing away the glass and rubble in front of the entrance, desperately digging in he rubble for a hole so she can come through. She never does. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I push aside rubble and kick and scream and bite at anyone who tries to touch me, until my vision turns black and a sharp pain fills my head. I try to resist, but soon everything is black. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wake up lying against the car, with both my parents and those of Olive bending over me. I sit up, dizzy, and my head throbbing. And see the burning building of the swimming pool in front of me. I start crying. I know Olive isn’t here, and I don’t understand. There are people in fancy suits going into the building, and spraying water at the fire, but I don’t care. I don’t care, I don’t know, I just want Olive. I climb into the car seat and wait for Olive to join me. I wait for hours, and fall asleep. The parking place is blocked, and we can’t leave. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>My parents stay awake for a long time- both my parents and Olive’s help clear the rubble; they stay up all night, and I know that Olive must be helping them- she’s so sympathetic, she could never fall asleep like I’m doing in a situation like this. I watch my Olive’s parents be approached by a lady and the little brown haired boy, with tears in her eyes. They talk, and I see Olive’s mom start crying, reaching out to the small child, who is babbling excitedly to his mother. I hate the child. Her father approaches one of the fancy-suit men, and talks with him. The man talks back, and then they both disappear into the building.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wake up for the second time in the dark car, on my mother’s lap. She’s tired, and watching me. I watch her, and ask when Olive will join us. She looks away, and doesn’t answer. I look out the window, the bright lights illuminating the sky. I laugh, and memorize the image to tell Olive when I wake up. But I don’t wake up. The dream doesn’t end, so I keep laughing, and then I start crying and I don’t know why. Mom strokes my hair, and I can see something on her face that I can’t place, and it scares me, and I start laughing again, and stop laughing, trace my finger over her face, feel its tightness. It’s wet, tense, cold, and there are tears in her eyes. At once, I open the car door to go look for Olive. She’s been gone for long enough. I’ll find her and then she’ll tell me what’s going on. She’ll know what mom’s face means. Mom stops me. She looks into my eyes and says something. I scream. I don’t remember stopping.</p>
