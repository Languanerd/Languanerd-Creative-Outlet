        <h1>Within</h1>
        <p>I get the feeling of being stuck in a bubble. A bubble may seem fragile, but it is a complete sphere. It has no start, no finish. It has a beginning and an end, but when it is created, it molds into one. It becomes one- it is no longer separated by beginning and end. It is impenetrable, unless outside forces interact with it. When I say I am trapped in a bubble, I say that I am within this bubble, that can only be penetrated from the outside. There is no stability, no right and left, no up and down, no reality within the bubble, simply existence, a gentle chaos. A bubble is beautiful, but also mildly transparent. I am trapped in an endless existence outside of reality, but can see very well into it, through innocent presence. I see all the problems, immorality, hatred, evil that immerses this world, and cannot do anything about it. I see all the wonders, joy, love, and laughter that is passed down from parent to child, yet cannot participate. Such is the life within a bubble. </p>
        <p>Though I think that many of us can relate to this feeling, it is not true. The feeling is common, and we are not alone in the struggle. A bubble can be penetrated, we can wave from the inside, we have human creativity that allows us to think outside of the box. We can steer the bubble in the direction of a tree, we can balance our weight so that it lands on a wind current. We can sit there and cry in hopeless frustration.  </p>
        <p>What is really within? Insecurity, fear, loneliness, hurt. A bubble can feel nice because it shields you from others, shields you from more hurt. It is a great short term solution but in the long term it is lethal. It destroys us, burning us up slowly, from the inside- it makes the feelings worse. The bubble is beautiful, but it is deceiving. You can penetrate it. Just because you're inside of the bubble doesn't mean you're helpless; you have influence in a way that nobody else does.  </p>
        <h2>Chains</h2>
        <p>There are some who specialize in creating necklaces and other jewelery from these bubbles. They gather what they can find to string them together for a jewel to adorn themselves with. What is the effect on those of us inside these bubbles? While a bubble with a trapped being inside may be the most beautiful ornament to one, a scepter to another, and a tripping stone to another, to us it creates a prison. </p>
        <p> Be wary! My fellow humans, be wary of those predators around you who take advantage of your weaknesses, be they little or great. There are many out there, and too many fall victim to these merciless predators. These predators suck the very sould from you, though they are not aware of doing it. Be wary, fellow humans, for no predators know it of themselves. Be wary, be cautious, be careful, I beseech you- too many have fallen victim already. Do not join them.</p>
        <h3>A field of bubbles</h3>
        <p>Bubbles are not always a symbol of evil, power, or enprisonment. They also symbolize beauty, love, innocence, lightness, and laughter. They radiate the colors of the rainbow, and dye their hide a magnificent blue. We can see through them, yet they have color. They are truth, they are honesty, they are beauty. A field of them emerges, and a doe with her youngster come running through. The bubbles dance around them, flaring up and popping with their movement, creating a rythm that fills the air with joy and a music that is unknown to the ears. The mother stands on her hind legs, and the blue is reflected on her face, radiating beauty and pleasure. A shot sounds, and the doe falls, with a dull thud and a splash of red. All around bubbles are popping, involuntarily, falling from the sky, fading in color. The human has come. When shall we learn? When shall we appreciate beauty for what it is? When shall we be content with the natural beauty nature gives us, and stop attempting to take it for ourselves? We do not achieve more than fractions of it, and by claiming these fractions we destroy the whole. the true beauty is gone. When shall humans learn to appreciate? To thank? To love? To accept? To be content? Humans are selfish, filled with hatred, greed, and the need for physical desires. They have lost sight of the true beauty.</p>
        <p>Is there still hope? Yes- but not if humans do not come to peace with each other and with their surroundings. The outings of hatred must stop, the greed must vanish; the love must come forth, the care shown through gentle and caring hands. When humans, nature, and the abstract reconcilliate, harmony will ensue. We will thrive, and so will they. But our nature is corrupted, and there are very few who are willing to start this process, however futile it may be. Each attempt is a step forward; each act is either a match lit, or a match blown out. Which shall you be? Can we work together to preserve the beauty of nature, our nature, concepts, and us? Can we let love surface? </p>
