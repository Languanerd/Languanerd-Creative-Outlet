        <p>My mind is usually triggered by a lot of things around me- practically everything, especially nature and feelings. I typically express myself by drawing and writing, which I will share with you here. I hope you guys will be inspired to creatively express the ideas you have in your head. Everyone has them, although some people need to put more effor tin digging deeper for them. Everyone is unique- put that on paper. Put you on paper.</p>

        <p class="special-font">Who says concepts can't be captured? I just proved the oppposite. But concepts cannot be captured for long, because a human cage does not capture something that exists outside of humanity (a concept is intangible). Acids are coming to its aid; evil coming to aid evil; the shadow is on the verge of escaping and its messengers have already gone out to spread the word. The world is protected by its archenemy- a cover of love. How long will it last? How long will be be able to resist the concepts of evil slowly seeping through the cracks of our barrier? At the rate humanity is going, I'm afraid we're digging a hole in our own protection. It will take serious effort on our part to revive our protection and keep the evil out. When the shadow escapes, it will be good against evil. What will prevail?</p>
