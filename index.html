        <h1>The Abyss of My Mind</h1>
        <p>My mind is usually triggered by a lot of things around me; concepts, emotions, ideas, actions, events, objects- practically everything. I've written things, drawn things, and let it out another way. But I haven't shared things, so that's what I'll be doing here- and I hope you guys will be inspired to write down or draw out the ideas you have in your head- everyone has them. Some people just need to dig deeper; put more effort into finding them. Everyone is unique- put that on paper. Put you on paper. And share it with the world, or at least with your community or friends. Let them understand and marvel at your uniqueness.</p>
