        <p> Even the strong are weak. Even Archilles had an unprotected heel. We have models, and so do they. We are never what we aim to be; another being. We will never be what we aim to be, as long as that stays our ambition. We keep looking up at those we admire, and wishing we could be them. If we spend our lives wondering then what have we done to our own potential? People are respected and admired for their uniqueness- when we aim to copy someone we admire, we will never gain admiration to the level we want it, because we have never devloped our own uniqueness. Do not spend your life chasing after the life of another, but look into your own life and see the potential! Look at you! You are unique, and if you want to gain admiration and respect from those around you, you have to develop it. Not someobody else's uniqueness- because you can't. Nobody can. Be you. </p>
