        <p> Even the strong are weak. Even Archilles had an unprotected heel. We have models, and so do they. We will never be what so many of us devote our lives to being; another. We admire the personalities and achievements of others- dare I say worship? by attempting to copy them, stashing away our own potential. But they are wrong- we're all wrong. We don't achieve admiration and respsect through our actions, achievements, or personality. This seems so on the surface because all those we admire have these traits, but the real thing lies deeper. We admire people for their authenticity, for their uniqueness- their ability to do things their way, things that other people cannot do. What makes them them them is themselves. If you succeed in 'becoming another' you will receive admiration. But it is not healthy admiration, nor one that gives happiness. This admiration is for the actions, for your hard work, for your achievements, and when we get so much admiration for these things, we lose all respect for who we are. When we lose respect for who we are, we lose the happiness in all we achieve, or what we pretend to be. It will result in a cylce of pain. If we want to receive real admiration, admiration for who we are, then we must be ourselves and set the example for others. There will be opposition, but that is a part of life. When you are yourself, you will find that the admiration you receive will create happiness that far outweighs the negative aspects of pretending to be another. I hope you will listen to this. You need to be you. You and nobody else. You.</p>
